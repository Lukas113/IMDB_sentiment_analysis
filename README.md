# IMDB Sentiment Analysis
Here, we attempt to classify the reviews of movies on the IMBD review dataset https://www.kaggle.com/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews as to whether they are positive or negative. For this purpose, we use a pre-trained deep neural network DistilBert and develop a model on it. In addition, we create a benchmark SVM.
